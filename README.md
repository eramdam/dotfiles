# dotfiles

Collection of actually-not-dot files. I've switched to using [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) for some years now for the actual dotfiles sync/backup.

# Wait, what the globe are all these files ?

+ `bin/core` gets the main scripts.
+ `bin/usr` gets the custom scripts (mainly used by alias of all sorts).
+ `useful-conf` some stuff that can't really be automated by some ways.

# Installation

Clone the repo and do :

```bash
./runmah
```

And boom !

# Plugins used
+ **ZSH**: [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
